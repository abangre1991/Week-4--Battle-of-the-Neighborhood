It will help people make smart and efficient decisions on selecting a great neighborhood out of a number of other neighborhoods in Scarborough, Toronto.\n\nLots of people are migrating to various states of Canada and need lots of research for good housing prices and reputed schools for their children. This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods. For the ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like minded people, etc.\n\nThis Project provides an analysis of features for people migrating to Scarborough,looking for best neighborhoods comparing between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both fresh and waste water and excreta conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\n\nIt will help people get an awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Target Audience"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "I believe this is a relevant challenge with valid questions for anyone moving to a large city in Toronto.
